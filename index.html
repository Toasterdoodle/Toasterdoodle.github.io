                WAYLAND, MA - In an attempt to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to providing its students with a world-class education, the town of Wayland, Massachusetts has decided to abolish its high school teachers. “We believe that, in the modern age of information, high school teachers just aren’t necessary anymore,” states Allyson Mizoguchi, the principal of Wayland High School. “Kids these days can learn whatever they need to learn by watching a Khan Academy video or by reading the explanation to an answer on Yahoo Answers. Furthermore, we find that teachers frequently burden their students with information that they will not be tested on, resulting in lower test scores.” Instead of having teachers, Wayland High School decided to transition to a system called “Test-based learning,” in which a student would have a test at the end of every week, and they would use the rest of the week to study. The move has been hailed by parents as revolutionary and groundbreaking. “Ever since the high school decided to get rid of teachers, our son has gotten much higher test scores,” said Susan Cahaly, the mother of two Wayland High School students. “With these higher test scores, I think my sons could probably go to Harvard or MIT!” Parents in Wayland have much to be ecstatic about, for statistics collected by the high school after the end of second quarter showed that, on average, students had grades that were 5-10% better than last year.

                The majority of students also support the new change. One Wayland High School Junior, Owen Smith, is particularly happy about the new structure. “Ever since they got rid of teachers,” he says, “I was able to spend more time studying exactly what’s going to be on the test instead of wasting my time studying something that won’t.” Furthermore, Owen contends, “Teachers always say that they don't give grades, we earn them. If we’re earning the grades ourselves, then what even is their job?” Although most students support the adjustment, there are some who think that the new scheme stifles their natural curiosity. “I think that school is supposed to be about learning instead of testing,” says Student Council Vice President Ryan Urato. “Without teachers to inspire curiosity, learning just becomes a dull, pointless behavior meant to get us into the best college, so we can get a high paying job.”

                One group that vehemently opposes the new restructuring are the previous high school teachers of Wayland High School. “When it comes to education, kids shouldn’t be mercenaries,” says former physics teacher Kenneth Rideout. “The purpose of school isn’t to fill kids’ heads with pointless knowledge because, let’s be honest, you’re never going to use half of it. The purpose of school is to inspire a lifelong love of learning and to cultivate kids’ natural curiosities. If all you’re doing is giving kids tests and forcing them to memorize things, then not only are you failing to encourage a love of learning, you’re discouraging it.” Most teachers, however, do concede that kids are generally becoming less and less interested in learning in general. Eric Wolven, a former math teacher, remarks that “[During his class last year,] 9 times out of 10 when a student would raise their hand, it would be to ask if something is on the test.” Meanwhile, a former english teacher, Gwen Goldin, recalls from her class last year that “the kids don’t even read the books I assign them unless I tell them there’s going to be a reading quiz.” Rideout now works as a professional movie critic specializing in foreign films, Wolven is now a professional basketball coach at the University of Maryland, and Goldin is now a full-time writer specializing in young adult novels. Her newest book, “The Tragedy of Hamlit,” will be coming out next year.
